Heart Disease Prediction Web Application
This repository presents a web-based application developed using Python and the Flask framework. Its primary function is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of user-provided health parameters. This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating and deploying a machine learning model within a functional web interface.

To provide an accessible platform for predicting heart disease risk by leveraging a pre-trained machine learning model, showcasing capabilities in full-stack development with a focus on machine learning deployment.
